### Custom Soundscapes

A custom soundscape is a playlist of youtube links that you can customize to create your own ambiance. These are created within the settings screen. You can create as many custom soundscapes as you want and each custom soundscape can have as many tracks as you want.

Additionally, when listening to a custom soundscape, you can use the new "next" and "previous" buttons to switch tracks.
